	{
		name = ds00_japier
		title = Japier WarpJet
		description = An immensely powerful air-breathing engine. It produces thrust by compressing Atmosphere in its magnetic rail chamber to the point of pulsed ignition/detonation. Its secondary mode involves a capacitor system and grants higher thrust and Isp but is more taxing on the overall electrical system.

	{
		name = ds00_int_isru
		title = Aerodynamic Harvesters
		description = The Mk2 and RBM intakes are specialized and unique ISRU devices compatible with life support systems. This device functions in atmosphere and while submerged in ocean. At extreme speeds in Oxygenated atmosphere, this device produces Oxidizer by combination super-cooling, super-compressing incoming air with a very elaborate internal system.

	{
		name = ds00_int_speed
		title = Super Intake
		description = This intake device is focused on raw strength as an intake, not on ISRU abilities like the Mk2 and RBM intakes. It leverages WarpJet technology to provide far greater static suction speed, some in-built storage of Atmosphere, and higher performance at any speed and atmosphere pressure than most other intakes. All of its advantages mean nothing, however, to jet engines that use LiquidFuel and IntakeAir.
